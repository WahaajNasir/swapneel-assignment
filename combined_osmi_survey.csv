In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.",, I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...,,,,,,,,,,,,,53.0,female,,,,,,,2016

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  ,For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",,False,42.0,Male,United States of America,Florida,White,,United States of America,Florida,2019
